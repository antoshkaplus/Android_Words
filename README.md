# TODO

## overall
* later on make some progress graphs

* unit tests everywhere

* move to UUID

* fix web for words. show error. delete operation.

## guess word:

    have to write unittests for it
* if provide remove functionality add ability to alter (always)
* for translation list need ability to search for words, also some sorting, edit button to remove some.
* maybe some graph with statistics how user progresses. should be multiple parameters. maybe keep it through slider somehow.
* add setting for how long should reset game, maybe in the near future would need to create controller
* time period between words settings
* ability to go back (pressing back button, should be able to point out result)


## app
