Want to learn more English words. Hope this application is going to help me.

# Features



# TODO

## overall
* later on make some progress graphs
* add more games
* by hand testing notes
* unit tests everywhere

* move to UUID

* fix web for words. show error.

## guess word:
* **keep track of the score.** this feature should be tested first locally through remoteApi and after that on android device locally
    have to write unittests for it
* if provide remove functionality add ability to alter (always)
* for translation list need ability to search for words, also some sorting, edit button to remove some.
* maybe some graph with statistics how user progresses. should be multiple parameters. maybe keep it through slider somehow.
* add setting for how long should reset game, maybe in the near future would need to create controller
* time period between words settings
* ability to go back (pressing back button, should be able to point out result)


## app
* pass

## web
* show more error messages
* show authorization errors if exists
