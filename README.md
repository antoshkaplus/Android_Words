# Android_Words
Want to learn more English words. Hope this application is going to help me.


#TODO

##overall
* list of words with search
* create app one russian, 4 guesses... reverse way
* later on make some progress graphs
* add more games
* by hand testing notes
* unit tests

##guess word:
* keep track of the score
* nice synchronization. think about rules. downloading and uploading everything everytime is not a good idea
* if provide remove functionality add ability to alter (always)
* for translation list need ability to search for words, also some sorting, edit button to remove some.
* maybe some graph with statistics how user progresses. should be multiple parameters. maybe keep it through slider somehow.
* should make use of cursor from database connection sometime soon, as loading everything into the memory is going tot suck probably
* add setting for how long should reset game, maybe in the near future would need to create controller

##app
* user log out operation
* rethink log in
