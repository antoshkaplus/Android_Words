# TODO

## overall
* later on make some progress graphs
* add more games
* by hand testing notes
* unit tests everywhere
* move translation to UUID (this should help with problems that erase on synchonization)
* add abbreviation type: FYI - for your information, CYA - cover your ass

## guess word:
* **add date to score**
* if provide remove functionality add ability to alter (always)
* for translation list need ability to search for words, also some sorting, edit button to remove some.
* maybe some graph with statistics how user progresses. should be multiple parameters. maybe keep it through slider somehow.
* add setting for how long should reset game, maybe in the near future would need to create controller
* time period between words setting
* how many games to keep in history setting

## app
* pass

## web
