# Android_Words
Want to learn more English words. Hope this application is going to help me.

Goals:
* load words I don't know from different sources
* everyone should have translation
* create app one russian, 4 guesses... reverse way
* green, red colors
* add spelling in english
* later on make some progress graphs



* somehow I need to use google translate API

* because translating by hand sucks

native language
foreign language


translation
    native_word_id
    foreign_word_id

word
    word
    id



backend is not going to be implemented soon
