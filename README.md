# Android_Words
Want to learn more English words. Hope this application is going to help me.

Goals:
* load words I don't know from different sources
* everyone should have translation
* create app one russian, 4 guesses... reverse way
* green, red colors
* add spelling in english
* later on make some progress graphs


guess word:
* keep track of the score
* nice synchronization. think about rules. downloading and uploading everything everytime is not a good idea
* if provide remove functionality add ability to alter (always)
* for translation list need ability to search for words, also some sorting, edit button to remove some.
* maybe some graph with statistics how user progresses. should be multiple parameters. maybe keep it through slider somehow.
* should make use of cursor from database connection sometime soon, as loading everything into the memory is going tot suck probably
* add stting for how long should reset game, maybe in the near future would need to create controller

* somehow I need to use google translate API

* because translating by hand sucks

native language
foreign language


word;translation


to do::
ability to add new translations, with usage or TranslationApi from google

add backend... like we did in recursive lists. use google datastore api directly

implement different options , add more games

now it's time to write backend !!!!!
