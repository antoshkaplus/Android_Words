‘USED TO’ and ‘WOULD’

1. Both ‘used to’ and ‘would’ can be used to describe repeated actions in the past. 
They are virtually interchangeable, but from the point of view of style, it could 
be argued that ‘would’ is slightly more formal, more ‘bookish’ and can convey the idea 
that the speaker is reminiscing about the past. It is often used in writing to talk 
about the past in a misty-eyed, sentimental way. For example:

When I was young I used to go fishing.
I used to have a cat.
My grandfather would always smoke his pipe after dinner.
People would get very angry when the tax-collector came to town.

Further examples of ‘would’ used in this way are:
In those days people would draw water from the village well.
When I was a child I would wake up to the sound of birds singing.


2. Neither ‘used to’ nor ‘would’ can be used to refer to single actions in the past. 
For example, it would not be possible to use either form in this sentence:

In 1992 I moved from London to Leeds.


3. ‘Used to’ can also be used to describe past states, with verbs such as 
‘be’, ‘have’ and ‘live’. For example:

I used to live in France.
He used to have a beard.
This building used to be a hotel.


4. ‘Would’ cannot normally be used in such sentences, unless the state 
is repeated and qualified by an adverb such as ‘often’. For example:

When I was a student, I would often have a beard.

This suggests that the state was repeated several times over a period of years, 
  but it is a highly restricted use of ‘would’.


5. ‘Used to’ cannot be used to refer to specific restricted periods in the past. For example:

In September 1991 I used to live in Paris
This sentence is incorrect and the past simple should be used.
